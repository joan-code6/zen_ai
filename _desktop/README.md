# Desktop / Web (Flutter + Electron)

This folder will contain the Flutter web project and Electron wrapper for desktop builds.

Plan:
- Use Flutter Web for the web UI.
- Use Electron to wrap the web build for desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux).

I can scaffold a minimal Flutter web project and a basic Electron `main.js` + `package.json` if you'd like â€” say the word and I'll create them.
