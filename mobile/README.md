# Mobile (Flutter)

This folder will contain the Flutter mobile app.

Quick start (high level):
- Install Flutter SDK: https://flutter.dev
- Create a new app: `flutter create mobile_app` or replace with the provided project
- Add Firebase packages for auth/firestore/messaging
- Use `lib/` for shared UI and business logic

I'll scaffold a minimal Flutter app if you'd like â€” tell me to proceed and I'll create a starter `pubspec.yaml` and `lib/main.dart`.
