# Zen

Zen is a personal AI assistant designed to work seamlessly across devices.  
It combines a memory system, natural language understanding, and integrations with everyday tools to support the user in daily life.

## Core Ideas
- **Memory:** Zen keeps a structured note system where it can store and recall information about the user (preferences, tasks, events, etc.).  
- **Search:** The assistant can create and retrieve notes stored with keywords, dates and content.
- **Scheduling:** Zen can schedule tasks / actions like him being called every morning with the task to find the weather for the day and send a push notification to the users phone packed with a joke. 
- **Cross-device:** The assistant works on mobile, desktop, and web, syncing data to stay consistent everywhere.
- **Modules**: Zen can be given access to many different modules like a calendar, email, messaging and more.
- **APIs**: Zen can can make any network calls to any domain to get or send data.

## Features
- Quick mobile interface. (organization\android_layout_idea-1-0.png)  
- Reminders and event management.
- Context-aware responses by retrieving relevant memory notes.  
- Notifications and proactive reminders when it recognizes recurring patterns.  
- Extensible integrations (calendar, email, messaging).

## Vision
Zen should be a assistant that helps the user and knows them the best.
It should be fitted for any needs, from technical issues to scheduling a alarm or writing a email, zen should be there to help the user.

## Project Structure
- **Backend:** API server, memory storage, scheduling engine, integrations.  
- **Mobile App:** Quick access to voice commands, reminders, and notifications.  
- **Desktop app / Web app:** Main interface for managing notes, settings, and integrations. 


## Technology Stack & Implementation Plan

- **AI:** Google Gemini API (free tier) for natural language understanding and assistant features.
- **Authentication & Storage:** Firebase Authentication for user login; Firebase Firestore for structured note/memory storage; Firebase Cloud Messaging for notifications and real-time sync.
- **Backend:** Python (Flask) API server for custom logic, scheduling engine, and integrations. Host on a free/low-cost cloud (e.g., Render, Railway, or Google Cloud Run).
- **Mobile App:** Flutter for cross-platform (Android/iOS) with Firebase integration and Gemini API via REST.
- **Desktop/Web App:** Flutter Web for browser; Flutter with Electron for desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux) for a native-like experience. Integrate with Firebase and backend as above.
- **Integrations:** REST APIs for calendar, email, messaging modules.
- **Sync:** Firebase real-time sync for cross-device consistency.

This stack is cost-effective, scalable, and enables rapid cross-platform development.
